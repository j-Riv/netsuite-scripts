> A portlet is essentially a visual plug-in that you can add and arrange on your NetSuite dashboard to highlight certain information. It gives you a snapshot of your business, and the plethora of portlet options allow you to tailor your view. The Personalize Dashboard panel displays the content that you can add to your dashboard on tabs for Standard Content, Report Snapshots, and Trend Graphs. The portlets that you are currently using appear on the Currently Used tab.
